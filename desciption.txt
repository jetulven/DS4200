The surfing website features a clean and visually appealing design that enhances user experience while promoting the theme of surfing. Here’s a breakdown of the styling and customizations applied:

Background Images: Each page has a unique full-cover background image that reflects the essence of surfing. The home page showcases an engaging image of surfers, while the second page features a serene ocean view.

Responsive Design: The website utilizes CSS properties like flexbox to create a responsive layout. This ensures that content is well-aligned and visually appealing on various screen sizes, enhancing accessibility for mobile and desktop users.

Font Customization: Different font sizes are used for headings (h1 and h2) to create a visual hierarchy. The body text is styled to be smaller on the second page for better readability, ensuring that users can easily consume content.

Centering Elements: All text, navigation links, and images are centered to provide a harmonious look. This alignment directs users' attention and creates a balanced aesthetic throughout the pages.

Navigation Styling: The navigation menu features styled links with hover effects, allowing users to intuitively navigate between the home page and the second page while ensuring a cohesive design.

Footer Design: A fixed footer at the bottom of each page provides consistent contact information, reinforcing the website’s identity while maintaining easy access for users.

Overall, these styling and customization efforts combine to create an engaging, user-friendly surfing website that effectively conveys the lifestyle and benefits of surfing.
